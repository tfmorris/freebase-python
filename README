These are two independent python libraries for use in
accessing Freebase services from Python:

* metaweb-py is the older and simpler of the two.  It's an improved
  version of the metaweb.py module originally developed by David
  Flanagan as part of the original Freebase API documentation.

  Pros: Single file, simpler.

* freebase-api is a more ambitious library that is derived from
  code developed by Nick Thompson for accessing freebase services.

  Pros: Does more.

Both are available under a simple 2-clause BSD-style license that
should allow you to reuse this code in both open-source and
commercial projects.

If you have suggestions, bug fixes, or feature requests for either
of these, please let one of the maintainers know or you can
discuss it on the Freebase developers list.
